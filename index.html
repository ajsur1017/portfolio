            <h2>Never Stop Learning!</h2><br>
            <p>My name is Anthony Surace, a Software Engineer and Web Developer. I began my journey with <a
                    href="FreeCodeCamp.com" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp.com</a> in the begining of 2021. Immediately
                intrigued, I wanted more. From YouTube totorials, to reading documentation I wanted to try everything. I
                started looking into different schooling programs and bootcamps trying to find what was right for me.
                After some searching I found my self on General Assemblies website, scheduling a meeting to start my
                application process. After working on those inital projects learing things that I never thought I would
                be able to acomplish on my own, I was accepted! I started in July of 2021 which began the rigorous
                journey.</p><br>
            <p>In January of 2022 I sucessfully completed the Software Engineering Immersive Remote course with General
                Assembly. With my background using HTML, CSS, JavaScript; with ReactJS, VueJS, Ruby on Rails, PosgreSQL,
                jQuery, AJAX, Express, EJS as well as many others; my current focus is building full stack applications.
                I really enjoy bringing the simple JS functions to the forefront of UI/UX design.</p><br>
            <p>Before I began my journey into Software Engineering and Web Development. I studied Criminal Justice and
                grew an extensive background in Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice. Departubg ny carreer in Law
                Enforcement was no easy decision however, with a strong support system I moved on and finally pursue my
                ambition to work with computers. I plan to bring my strong leadership skills, communication and problem
                solving skills that I honed to perfection the table continue to help drive my colleagues and I to
                success in whatever challenges we face. </p><br><br>

            <h4>FitnessDOOD</h4><br>
            <a href="https://fitnessdood.netlify.app/" target="_blank"><img

                    alt="FitnessDOOD Preview Image Broken"></a><br><br>
            <p>FitnessDOOD was an application that I built as my capstone project for General Assembly. Hosted on
                Netlify, it is a CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) application that was built using Ruby on Rails with
                PostgreSQL for the backend database which is hosted on Heroku. The frontend uses Vue.js with vue-router
                and milligram.css. This
                application was designed to help me keep track of what I eat/drink during
                the day as well as some activity. If you are anything like me you struggle to keep track of all of those
                little things with everything else going on in our crazy lives.</p><br>
            <p>Currently this application does not have any Authentication, however I currently have a completed backend
                with JWT/bcrypt authentication that just require some front end work to be completed. Coming soon!</p>
            <br><br>

            <h4>Guardian Locker</h4><br>
            <a href="https://destiny-locker.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank"><img

                    alt="Guardian Locker Preview Image Broken"></a><br><br>
            <p>Guardian Locker is another CRUD application that was built using EJS with mongoDB for data management and
                express-session with bcrypt for authentication that is hosted live on Heroku. I am Hoplessly adictied to
                Destiny 2 and its where I
                draw about 60% of my creative ideas from. This application that I use daily, helps me keep track of
                different loadouts that I use in game as well as the very import aspect of fashion design in game. I am
                activly working on this application working on adding Bungies own API in hopes that it can one day
                become a featurned compaion app for Destiny 2. </p><br><br>

            <h4>Events-N-Stuff</h4><br>

                    alt="Events-N-Stuff Preview Image Broken"></a><br><br>
            <p>Events-N-Stuff is a application that was built as a part of a small team of developers where I was tasked
                with
                implementing JSON web token authentication as well as construction the backend database using express
                with MongoDB. The end result was a CRUD application that you can store, organize and even mark you
                attendance for different events. Features a CSS Carousel and uses Bootstrap.css for several design
                components. Some future goals the team and I have is to use this frontend application with a third part
                event API that stores and updates events nationwide!</p><br><br>

            <p>PokéSearch is a small application built for mobile that uses an Ajax function to make a call to a thrid
                party API by searching using the Pokémon name or ID number. The Next button generates a random number to
                use as a search parameter to display a random Pokémon to the user. Some unuique things here was the use
                of a default image rather than leaving the display area blank. </p><br><br>

            <p>This Itinerary day planner is an application built with Ruby on Rails using PostgreSQL for the backend
                database hosted on Heroku. The frontend which is live on Netlify, was buily using ReactJS. A CRUD
                application that is simple enough to understand even for my elderly grandparents, help you stay on track
                with you busy schedule throughout the day. Coming soon to this application in a future update is the
                ability to have a
